# CCL 0.2 Beta

C++ Complementary Library, or CCL for short, is a C++ library that aims to
complement the standard library. Its main features are support for Unicode,
a more modern I/O infrastructure and basic windowing capabilities. CCL is
written from scratch in C++20 and can be used header-only or compiled as
a static or dynamic library.

# Disclaimer

CCL is currently still in Beta and is not recommended for use in production
software. I am working hard to make CCL stable. If you like the value CCL
provides today, consider becoming a sponsor. CCL **will** be ready for
real-world use, it will just take longer to get there without funding.

# Documentation

CCL's documentation is available at CCL's website. There you can access the
API reference and a free introductory book. The book goes over how to build
CCL and use it in your own C++ projects.
