# CCL 0.1 Beta

C++ Complementary Library, or CCL for short, is a C++ library that aims to
complement the standard library. Its main features are support for Unicode
and a more modern I/O infrastructure. CCL is written from scratch in C++20
and can be used header-only or compiled as a static or dynamic library.

# Disclaimer

CCL is currently still in Beta and is not recommended for use in production
software. I am working hard to make CCL stable. If you like the value CCL
provides today, consider becoming a sponsor. CCL **will** be ready for
prime-time, it will just take longer to get there without funding.
